This script relies on nothing but core Perl modules and is able to
tell you about solstices and equinoxes in local time from 2004 to
2017.  It assumes you are in the Northern hemisphere.

It's in progress.  Right now, it just proves the concept with --since
and --last.

I've written several scripts to combine astronomical calculations with
calendrical and come up with local times for the equinoxes, solstices,
cross-quarter days, etc.  But they end up being very non-portable
because of huge library dependencies.

I would like a script I can run anywhere that can at least tell me
some basic info about the current time and its relation to the
seasons.  It finally dawned on me that if I didn't try to do astro
calculations, this would be easy.

TODO
- Finish it.
- Let user specify Southern hemisphere.
- Expand the data set.
- Write --help.
