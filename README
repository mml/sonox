This script relies on nothing but core Perl modules and is able to
tell you about solstices and equinoxes in local time from 2004 to
2017.  It assumes you are in the Northern hemisphere.

    Usage: sonox [OPTIONS]

    If no OPTIONS, defaults to --since.

      -h, --help    This text.
      --southern    Assume Southern hemisphere rather than Northern.
      --since       Show number of days since last solstice or equinox.
      --until       Show number of days until next solstice or equinox.
      --last[=N]*   Show last N solstices and equinoxes.
      --next[=N]*   Show next N solstices and equinoxes.
      --year[=Y]**  Show all 4 solstices and equinoxes for the year Y.

    * N defaults to 1.  But values other than 1 aren't currently implemented.

    ** This feature not yet implemented.  Y defaults to the current year.

I've written several scripts to combine astronomical calculations with
calendrical and come up with local times for the equinoxes, solstices,
cross-quarter days, etc.  But they end up being very non-portable
because of huge library dependencies.

I would like a script I can run anywhere that can at least tell me
some basic info about the current time and its relation to the
seasons.  It finally dawned on me that if I didn't try to do astro
calculations, this would be easy.

TODO
- Finish it.
- Expand the data set.
